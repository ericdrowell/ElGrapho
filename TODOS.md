# TODOS

## P0
* force directed graph model

## P1
* setup test app that pulls in elgrapho and bundles it
* tests and github CI
* node events should include x,y mouse position, or at least mouse event object
* tooltips are slow in big network graph.
* labels
* lines get fat sometimes when viz stretched.

## P1
* Radial tree
* consider rework clusters to cluster by edges, not colors.  The result should be less cross connections between clusters
* new chart controls - expand/shrink along x or y

## P2
* can I use ints in glsl where appropriate? Right now using all floats
* back and forward buttons to go through state stack (pan and zoom)
* chord diagram
* antialiased nodes - seems to require APIs in webgl2.  Currently using webgl1.
